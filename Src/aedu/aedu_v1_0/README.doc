CPC Program Librarian’s note

The CPC distribution file contains this README file and 12 directories,

imagtime1d			realtime1d
imagtime2d			realtime2d
imagtime3d			realtime3d
imagtimeaxial			realtimeaxial
imageimecir			realtimecir
imagtimesph			realtimesph

Each of these directories contains a .tar file which holds the Fortran program code file(s) and sample output files for the 1d, 2d etc. form of the calculation.

Example compilation script

g95 -o  imagtime1d.exe  imagtime1d.F

Example run script

./imagtime1d.exe

Authors’s note

The programs solve the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation with a specific nonlinearity (Input Parameter G0) to a desired (high) level of accuracy. However, in many cases one may need an approximate solution (with lower accuracy) involving less CPU time or one may need to solve the GP equation for a different value of nonlinearity. This can be done by changing a few cards as described below:


(1) Changing the value of nonlinearity (G0): If G0 is reduced, just change the card defining G0. However, if G0 is increased, changing the value of G0 may not be enough.  For an increased G0, the wave function extends to a larger region in space. One may need to increase the Number of space mesh points". For a new G0, just plot the output file fort.3 for all programs except realtime3d.F, realtime3d.f90, imagtime3d.F and imagtime3d.f90, where one should plot output files fort.11, fort.12, and fort.13 and see that the wave function is fully and adequately accommodated in the space domain. If not, one needs to increase the number in input cards "Number of space mesh points" until the wave function is fully and adequately accommodated in the space domain.

(2) The CPU time involved can be reduced by sacrificing the precision. 
This can be done by increasing the space step(s) and time step and reducing the "Number of space mesh points". If the space step is increased by a factor of f = 2, the number of space mesh points should be reduced by the same factor. The time step should be increased by a larger factor, more like f**2. The optimum increase in time step should be determined by some experimentation. The CPU time is the largest in the case of programs realtime3d.F, realtime3d.f90, imagtime3d.F and imagtime3d.f90 and we give an example of changes below in these cases to reduce the CPU time. 

For realtime3d.F, just change the lines  15, 16, 17, and 39.  The new 
set of lines are 

      PARAMETER (NX=40, NXX = NX-1, NX2 = NX/2)
      PARAMETER (NY=32, NYY = NY-1, NY2 = NY/2)
      PARAMETER (NZ=24, NZZ = NZ-1, NZ2 = NZ/2)
      DATA DX /0.5D0/, DY /0.5D0/,  DZ /0.5D0/, DT/0.05D0/
   
For imagtime3d.F, just change the lines  15, 16, 17, and 37.  The new
set of lines are

      PARAMETER (NX=24, NXX = NX-1, NX2 = NX/2)
      PARAMETER (NY=20, NYY = NY-1, NY2 = NY/2)
      PARAMETER (NZ=16, NZZ = NZ-1, NZ2 = NZ/2)
      DATA DX /0.5D0/, DY /0.5D0/,  DZ /0.5D0/, DT/0.04D0/
