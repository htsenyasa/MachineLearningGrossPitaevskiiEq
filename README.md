# Abstract

We train a convolutional neural network to estimate the ground state energy
of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in different type of random potentials.
Such a system can be described by the solution of a non-linear Schrödinger
equation also called a Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We also use the method for the
inverse problem of predicting the non-linearity parameter using the ground state
density proﬁle and the trapping potential.

# Notes
This is a project from 2017-2018, in the context of machine learning it does not involves anything fancy but the project has a relatively good random potential generator.
