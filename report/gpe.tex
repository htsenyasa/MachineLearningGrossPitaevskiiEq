\section{\label{sec:level1}Gross-Pitaevskii Equation}

Since we are going to try to guess ground state energy for a given potential,
we should first able to generate train data. To do that, we require analytic
and numerical solutions for energy values. 

Gross-Pitaevskii Equation is given as;

$$ i\hslash \frac {\partial \psi}{\partial t} = \frac {-\hslash}{2m} \nabla^2
\psi + V(r)\psi + g|\psi|^2\ \psi  $$

The coefficient of the non-linear term determines the interaction type. 
If there is no interaction $g = 0$ and equation reduces the Schrodinger Equation. For repulsive interactions
$g > 0$, and $g < 0$ for attractive. \\


%de Broglie wavelength of the particles are nearly
%equal to the distance between particles and interactions in condensate are weak. These two conditions make us able to treat the condensation as
%a huge wave.\\
%Three body interactions and higher are negligible.
%
%The physical interpretation of the nonlinear term is that, at a given
%point in space, there is an energy contribution arising from the mean-field
%interactions of all the atoms in the immediate vicinity.


\textbf{Time Independent GPE}\\
If the given potential is independent of time, GPE is separable and there are
stationary solutions. \\


\textbf{Stationary Solutions}

When the potential is given, characteristic of the system is determined by
non-linear term's coefficient, g as shown below. Symmetric harmonic potential is,
$$ V(\textbf{r}) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 r^2 $$

It is convenient to define characteristic length and interaction parameter (IP) to describe strength of the interactions which are given by respectively,

$$ l_r = \sqrt{\frac{\hslash}{m \omega_r}}$$ 
$$  \frac{N a_s}{l_r} $$ 

where $a_s$ is s wave scattering length.

if $ IP \gg 1 $, it corresponds to strong repulsive interaction, $ IP < 1 $, weak interactions.  

In no interaction case which means $g = 0$, GPE reduces to SE. This leads us to
obtain well known harmonic potential solutions. Energy is given by,

$$ E = \frac{3}{2}N \hslash \omega_r$$

In strong repulsive interaction, there is no analytic solution. We can obtain 
energy values by solving the GPE numerically or by approximation which is known as Thomas-Fermi approximation. Approximation requires negligence of the 
$\nabla^2\psi$ term. When the equation is solved and normalized condition is satisfied, energy is $$ E = \frac{5}{7} \mu N $$ and $$ \mu = \frac{\hslash \omega_r}{2} (\frac{15Na_s}{l_r})^\frac{2}{5} $$

\textbf{Reduction of Dimension}

The shape of the condensate can be controlled by applied potential. When harmonic potential is symmetric, shape of the condensate is spherical but if we
increase the $\omega_z$ component of the potential for fixed $\omega_y, \omega_x$, we can reshape it into pancake like shaped. In this case, condensate can be described by z component and system can be represented by 1D GPE which is given as,

$$ \mu_{1D}\psi_z = \frac {-\hslash}{2m} \frac{d^2\psi}{dz^2}
+ V(z)\psi_z + g_{1D}|\psi_z|^2\ \psi_z $$



(ground state density is directly proportional to s wave scattering length,
since g is function of s wave scattering length.)

(It also shows that for $g < 0$, system is not stable since density cannot be negative.)
