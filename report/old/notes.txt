mu must be greater than zero for bose einstein dist equation.
Otherwise, it represents no physical quantity.

As E-> mu from, Bose-Einsten distribution diverges. (Particles
accumulate in the lowest energy level)


Bose-Einstein Condansate occurs in two way, the first one is increasing
number of particles in the system while temperature is held fix and
the second one is decreasing the temperature of the system to T_c where
T_c is critical temperature.

Direct integration of BE Distribution doesn't give the first scenario
explicitly. Because, to make summation an integration, we have to treat
all energy levels as continious quantity. In this case integration doesn't
involve ground state contribution properly.

###Gross-Pitaevskii Model of the Condensate###


It is said that de broglie wavelength of the particles are nearly
equal to the distance between particles.

"Interactions in atomic BECs are weak".

These two conditions make us able to treat the condensation as
a huge wave.

Three body interactions and higher are negligable.

The physical interpretation of the nonlinear term is that, at a given
point in space, there is an energy contribution arising from the mean-field
interactions of all the atoms in the immediate vicinity.

The quantity "g" depends on the given atomic species and can be positive or
negative.

g > 0 repulsive
g < 0 attractive
g = 0 no interactions

Normalization condition the GPE is different from SE. GPE is normalized to the
total number of particle, in this case probability density corresponds to number density.
Since the number density is known we can also get the mass density by simply multiplying
the number density with mass of the particle.



###Time Independent GPE###

GPE is seperable. It can be written as multiplication of spatial and time part.

MU EQUATION

Here mu expressed as summation of energy values which means it is positive. This is
also consistent with BE distribution since, in BE distribution mu cannot be negative.


###Stationary Solutions in Infinite or Semi-Infinite Homogeneous Systems###

As plane wave or finite well solutions of SE, we can apply same method to GPE to discover
fundamental properties of the atomic condansates.

Since we are going to try to guess ground state energy for a given potential,
we should first able to generate train data. To do that, we require analytical
and numerical solutions. Analytical solutions will be used for spesific potentials
such as harmanic potential and numerical solutions for random potentials.

(We can also obtain a relation between ground state density and interaction parameter.)

##Uniform Condensate##

This solutions shows that,

ground state density is directly proportional to s wave scattering length,
since g is function of s wave scattering length.

It also shows that for g < 0, system is not stable since density cannot be negative.

##Condenstae Near a Wall##

It is said that normalization condition of the GPE is the total number of particles,
for x < 0, there can be no particles and this condition can be obtain only if the wave
function is set to zero. (Second condition Bulk Form ?)

g = 0 means there is no interactions between particles, and number density is given by
SE solution which is sinisoidal function.

##Stationary Solutions in Harmonic Potentials###

There are three scenerio we are going to study; no interactions (g = 0), strong repulsive
interactions (g < 0) and weak interactions (g < 0).

When g = 0, GPE reduces to SE and we can drive well known analytical solutions. The energy
term is given by E = 3Nhw/2.

The strong and weak interactions is determined by N a_s / l_r expression. When it is
much greater than 1 it is strong interactions and if it is much less than 1, interaction
is weak.

In strong repulsive case, there is no analytical solutions. We can use numerical methods,
or Thomas-Fermi appraximation. In Thomas-fermi appraximation del^2 psi term is neglected.

The energy term provided by Thomas-Fermi approximation is given as,

E = 5muN/7

## Weak Interactions ##


## Anisotropic Harmonic Potentials and Condensates
of Reduced Dimensionality ##

Dimensionality of the condensate can be reduced by appiled potential. If the w_x * w_y
much greater than the w_z, system can be describe with 1D GPE. In this case, psi_z is
used as wave function and it is normalized to the N. Other components are normalized to the one.

This reduction, however, limits us in someways.
