III. Analytical, Numerical Solution and Generating Dataset

    a) Types of potential
        a.1) Harmonic trap (for now)


    b) Analytical Solution
        ---

    c) Numerical Solution and XMDS Framework
        c.1) XMDS
            c.1.1) Mention that potential is generated by XMDS according to given equation if it is not given as vector.
            c.1.2)


        c.2) Details about solution method (short)
            c.2.1) Imaginary Time (Cite directly from website) // Should it be here or at APPENDIX ?
            c.2.2) Grid and Boundaries
            c.2.3) Sensitivity of solutions and comparision with analytical solutions if it possible. (convince the reader that numerical method works)

    d) Generating Dataset
        d.1) Mention that how many datasets there are and their differences
            d.1.1) no interaction parameter, number of elements in dataset
            d.1.2) intercation parameter, values of the interaction parameter, number of elements in dataset


IV. Machine Learning

    a) Pytorch (Short)
        a.1) CPU and GPU  // ??
        a.2) Tensor       // ??

    b) Architecture
        b.1) Fully-connected Feedforward
        b.2) CNN

    c) Hyperparameters of the arch.
        c.1) Learning rate, epoch, batch-size
        c.2) Comparison of different hyper-parameter // (??)

    d) Training
        d.1) How loss changes (Plot)
            d.1.1) Feedforward
            d.1.2) CNN
